# so fetch (post)!

This is a fork fo sofetch, that allows for POST request and ftp request to be forwarded, I used this for personal uses, I also want to support websocket proxies, and even just plain tcp over websockets, because it's nice to do all of that from JavaScript without ever leaving the browser :D
